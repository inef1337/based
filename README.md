# Based - A Minimalistic Base

Based is a minimalistic base for GTA Story Mode that aims to fill the void of a base without nonessential features. This code provides a simple logging system, an asynchronous signature scanner, and a basic D3D11 ImGui-based List UI. It also includes a wrapper for MinHook, making it a bit easier to hook and call functions.

## Features

* A logging system that allows you to log messages to files, format strings with variables such as integers, and more.
* An asynchronous signature scanner that makes it easy to scan for signatures.
* A basic GUI that allows you to access and handle features easily.
* A wrapper for MinHook, making it easy to hook functions.

## Credits

* [Pocakking](https://github.com/Pocakking) for developing the native invoker Based utilizes and for creating the signature scanner that serves as the foundation for Based's scanning capabilities.
* [TsudaKageyu](https://github.com/TsudaKageyu) for creating the minimalistic hooking library MinHook, which is used in Based to facilitate function hooking.
* [ocornut](https://github.com/ocornut) for developing Dear ImGui, the library that’s utilized for rendering the list GUI.
* [Ozark Developer(s)](https://ozark.gg/) for some UI inspiration.
* [iAmCallumx](https://github.com/iAmCallumx) for providing moral support and watching Netflix with me during the entire development process. 

The contributions of these individuals were instrumental in the creation of Based.

## Target Audience

Based is directed towards anyone who likes or would like to make a mod menu for GTA Story Mode. It's a great option for those who prefer a minimalistic design and only need essential features. The base is easy to use and customize, making it accessible for almost anyone given they have invested some time into C++.

## Future Plans

I might perform updates or changes to the project depending on how well the project is received. This, for instance, could include a modifier option, an array option, a greater handling of threads, etc. I just didn’t see the point of doing all that if no one is going to use it anyway.
