#Based - A Minimalistic Base  

Based is a minimalistic base for GTA Story Mode that aims to fill the void of a base without nonessential features. This code provides a simple logging system, an asynchronous signature scanner, and a basic D3D11 ImGui-based List UI. It also includes a wrapper for MinHook, making it a bit easier to hook and call functions.

#Features  

- A logging system that allows you to log messages to files, format strings with variables such as integers, and more.
- An asynchronous signature scanner that makes it easy to scan for signatures.
- A basic GUI that allows you to access and handle features easily.
- A wrapper for MinHook, making it easy to hook functions.
Credits
Pocakking for developing the native invoker Based utilizes and for creating the signature scanner that serves as the foundation for Based's scanning capabilities.
TsudaKageyu for creating the minimalistic hooking library MinHook, which is used in Based to facilitate function hooking.
ocornut for developing Dear ImGui, the library that’s utilized for rendering the list GUI.
Ozark Developer(s) for some UI inspiration.

Target Audience
Based is directed towards anyone who likes or would like to make a mod menu for GTA Story Mode. It's a great option for those who prefer a minimalistic design and only need essential features. The base is easy to use and customize, making it accessible for almost anyone given they have invested some time into C++.

Future Plans
I might perform updates or changes to the project depending on how well the project is received. This for instance could include a modifier option, an array option, a greater handling of threads, et cetera. I just didn’t see the point of doing all that, if no one is going to use it anyways.
